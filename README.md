# Food-Delivery-Java


KathFoodDelivery is a simple food delivery application that allows customers to place orders from three different restaurants: Jollibee, KFC, and Shakey's. The program features an interactive command-line interface that lets customers enter their personal details, select restaurants, browse menus, and place orders.

# Features:
1. Customer Order Placement:
  * Customers can enter their name, address, and contact details.
  * The program allows customers to select a restaurant from a list (Jollibee, KFC, Shakey's).
  * Customers can view the menu of the selected restaurant, make their selections, and calculate the total cost, including shipping charges.
  * After reviewing the order, customers can confirm or cancel their orders.

2. Admin Panel:
  * The Admin Panel provides restricted access to administrators via a password.
  * Admins can view all customer orders and delete orders as necessary.

3. Order Queuing:
  * Orders are queued in the system, ensuring that customer orders are processed one by one. Each new order is added to the queue, and customers can be served in the order they were placed.
  * The queuing system ensures that orders are handled efficiently and prevents conflicts in the order processing.

4. Menu Display:
  * Menus for Jollibee, KFC, and Shakey's are pre-defined and presented to the customer when placing an order.

5. Order Details Formatting:
  * Orders are displayed in a user-friendly, well-formatted manner for both customers and administrators.
  * The total cost of each order is displayed with proper formatting for easy readability (e.g., Php 1,234.56).

6. Order Confirmation:
  * After the user places an order, they are prompted to confirm or cancel their order.
  * If confirmed, the order is saved in the system.

Shipping Costs:
  * Each restaurant has a predefined shipping cost (e.g., Jollibee: Php 50, KFC: Php 55, Shakey's: Php 60).
